# Aircraft-Image-Classification-Models-with-Numpy

This repository contains a preprocessing code, Convolutional Neural Network, and a Logistic Regression Model for classification of aircraft images. These models are created using only numpy library. The dataset contains six classes of aircrafts. 

For preprocessing, see the descriptions in Image_Process.ipynb .
